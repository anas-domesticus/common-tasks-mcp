# Relationship type definitions for the task graph
#
# This file defines the types of relationships that can exist between tasks.
# Each relationship type forms its own directed acyclic graph (DAG).
#
# Fields:
#   - name: The identifier for this relationship type (used in task EdgeIDs)
#   - description: Human-readable explanation of what this relationship means
#   - direction: How this relationship flows relative to execution order
#       - "backward": Points to things that come before (e.g., prerequisites)
#       - "forward": Points to things that come after (e.g., downstream tasks)
#       - "none": No temporal ordering implied

relationships:
  # Tasks that must be completed before this task can run
  - name: prerequisites
    description: Tasks that must be completed before this node
    direction: backward

  # Tasks that must be completed after this task
  - name: downstream_required
    description: Tasks that must be completed after this node
    direction: forward

  # Tasks that are recommended to run after this task
  - name: downstream_suggested
    description: Tasks that are recommended to be completed after this node
    direction: forward
