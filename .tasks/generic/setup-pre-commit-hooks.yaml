summary: Configure git pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
description: |-
    Sets up git pre-commit hooks to automatically run checks before commits.

    Common approaches:
    - pre-commit framework (Python): `pre-commit install` (requires .pre-commit-config.yaml)
    - Husky (Node.js): `npm install husky --save-dev && npx husky install`
    - Manual git hooks: Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` script

    Common pre-commit checks:
    - Code formatting (prettier, black, gofmt)
    - Linting (eslint, pylint, golangci-lint)
    - Type checking (mypy, TypeScript)
    - Test execution (fast unit tests)
    - Trailing whitespace removal
    - Large file prevention
    - Secret detection

    Pre-commit hooks help catch issues early and enforce code quality standards.

    Bypass hooks (use sparingly): `git commit --no-verify`
