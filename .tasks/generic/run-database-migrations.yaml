    Migration best practices:
    - Always backup database before migrations
    - Test migrations in staging environment first
    - Write reversible migrations (with down/rollback)
    - Keep migrations in version control
    - Run migrations as part of deployment process

    Check migration status: Most tools have a status/history command
