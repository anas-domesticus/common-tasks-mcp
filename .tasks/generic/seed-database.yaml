name: Seed Database with Test Data
summary: Populate database with test/sample data
description: |-
    Seeds the database with test or sample data for development and testing.

    Common seeding approaches by framework:
    - Python/Django: `python manage.py loaddata fixtures.json` or custom management commands
    - Ruby/Rails: `rails db:seed` (runs db/seeds.rb)
    - Node.js/Sequelize: `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`
    - PHP/Laravel: `php artisan db:seed`
    - Java: Custom SQL scripts or migration tools (Flyway, Liquibase)

    Generic approaches:
    - SQL script: `psql dbname < seed_data.sql` or `mysql dbname < seed_data.sql`
    - Custom scripts: Write scripts to generate and insert test data
    - Faker libraries: Generate realistic fake data (Faker.js, Faker Python, etc.)

    Use cases:
    - Development: Populate local database with realistic data
    - Testing: Consistent test fixtures
    - Demo: Sample data for demonstrations

    Caution: Never run seeds against production databases
