summary: Run integration tests that verify component interactions
description: |-
    Runs integration tests that verify multiple components work correctly together.

    Integration tests typically:
    - Test interactions between modules, services, or layers
    - May require external dependencies (databases, APIs, message queues)
    - Run slower than unit tests
    - Often run in CI/CD pipelines before deployment

    Common approaches by language:
    - Go: `go test -tags=integration ./...` or separate test directories
    - Python: `pytest tests/integration/` or `pytest -m integration`
    - Node.js: `npm run test:integration` (custom script)
    - Java: `mvn verify` or `gradle integrationTest`
    - Rust: `cargo test --test integration_*`

    Configure test tags, markers, or separate directories to distinguish integration from unit tests.
