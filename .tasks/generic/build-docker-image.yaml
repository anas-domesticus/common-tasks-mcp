name: Build Docker Image
summary: Build a Docker container image for the project
description: |-
    Builds a Docker container image from the project's Dockerfile.

    Basic command: `docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .`

    Common options:
    - `-t name:tag`: Tag the image with a name and version
    - `-f Dockerfile.prod`: Use a specific Dockerfile
    - `--build-arg KEY=VALUE`: Pass build arguments
    - `--target stage`: Build only up to a specific stage in multi-stage builds
    - `--no-cache`: Build without using cached layers

    Example: `docker build -t myapp:latest .`

    Multi-stage builds are common for optimizing image size by separating build and runtime dependencies.
