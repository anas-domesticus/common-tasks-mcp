summary: Run end-to-end tests that simulate real user workflows
description: |-
    Runs end-to-end (E2E) tests that simulate complete user workflows through the entire application.

    E2E tests typically:
    - Test the full application stack (frontend, backend, database)
    - Simulate real user interactions
    - Run in browser environments for web apps
    - Are the slowest and most expensive tests
    - Provide highest confidence in system behavior

    Common E2E frameworks:
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer
    - Python: Selenium, Playwright
    - Java: Selenium, Cucumber
    - Ruby: Capybara, Cucumber

    Example commands:
    - `npx playwright test`
    - `npx cypress run`
    - `pytest tests/e2e/`

    E2E tests often require a running instance of the application and dependencies.
