    Runs linters to check for code quality issues, potential bugs, and style violations.

    Common linters by language:
    - Go: `golangci-lint run` or `go vet ./...`
    - Python: `pylint` or `flake8` or `ruff check`
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: `eslint .` or `npm run lint`
    - Java: `checkstyle` or `pmd`
    - Rust: `cargo clippy`
    - Ruby: `rubocop`
    - C/C++: `clang-tidy` or `cppcheck`

    Linting should pass before merging code to main branch.
