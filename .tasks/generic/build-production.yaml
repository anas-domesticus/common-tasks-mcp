summary: Create optimized production build
description: |-
    Creates an optimized build suitable for production deployment.

    Production builds typically:
    - Enable optimizations (minification, tree-shaking, dead code elimination)
    - Remove debug symbols and logging
    - Bundle and compress assets
    - Generate source maps for debugging (separately)
    - Validate build artifacts

    Common commands by language/framework:
    - Go: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o app`
    - Node.js: `npm run build` or `yarn build` (typically runs webpack/vite/next)
    - Python: `python setup.py bdist_wheel` or `poetry build`
    - Java: `mvn package -P production` or `gradle build -Pproduction`
    - Rust: `cargo build --release`
    - Frontend: `npm run build` (React/Vue/Angular with production optimizations)

    Test the production build locally before deploying.
