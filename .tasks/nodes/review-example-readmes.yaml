summary: Review and validate README files in the examples directory for consistency and accuracy
description: |-
    Reviews README files in the docs/examples/ directory to ensure they are consistent with actual configuration files and sample nodes.

    Steps:
    1. Read the example's README.md in docs/examples/<example-name>/
    2. Read the corresponding mcp.yaml and relationships.yaml files
    3. Check that README describes the correct tool names (e.g., add_task vs add_recipe)
    4. Verify relationship names in README match relationships.yaml exactly
    5. Check that embedded YAML examples include all required fields (id, name, summary, description, tags, edges)
    6. Verify edge relationship names in examples match the relationships.yaml configuration
    7. Confirm README mentions all files that actually exist (nodes/, prompts/ directories)
    8. Check that tag suggestions align with actual tags used in sample nodes
    9. Validate any workflow diagrams match the actual node relationships
    10. Ensure running instructions reference correct directory paths

    Common issues to watch for:
    - READMEs showing old/incorrect relationship names
    - Embedded YAML examples missing required fields
    - Tool names not matching the singular/plural configuration
    - Missing mentions of included sample files
    - Overly verbose embedded examples (prefer referencing actual node files)
    - Inconsistent terminology between README and config files
