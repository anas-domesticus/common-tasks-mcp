name: Update Tasks Directory
summary: Add, update, or remove task definitions in the .tasks/ directory
description: |-
    Updates the project's task repository in the .tasks/ directory. This directory is used for dogfooding - tracking common development workflows for this project.

    Steps:
    1. Identify the task or workflow to document
    2. Check if a similar task already exists using `list_tasks` or by reviewing .tasks/nodes/
    3. Create new YAML file in .tasks/nodes/ with structure:
       - id: kebab-case-identifier
       - name: Human Readable Name
       - summary: One-line description
       - description: Detailed steps, commands, file locations
       - tags: Array of relevant tags (2-4 recommended)
       - edges: Relationship definitions (prerequisites, downstream_required, downstream_suggested)
    4. Ensure all referenced task IDs in edges actually exist
    5. Use appropriate tags: testing, documentation, build, deployment, validation, etc.
    6. Consider if this change should update .tasks/README.md (if it affects usage)
    7. Consider if this change should update main README.md (if it affects project documentation)

    File location: .tasks/nodes/<task-id>.yaml

    Relationship fields (from .tasks/relationships.yaml):
    - prerequisites: Tasks that must complete before this one
    - downstream_required: Tasks that must follow this one
    - downstream_suggested: Recommended follow-up tasks

    Best practices:
    - Keep tasks atomic (single purpose)
    - Be specific with commands and file paths
    - Use existing tasks as examples
    - Validate YAML syntax before committing
