# Relationship type definitions for repository task workflows
#
# This configuration defines three relationship types that form the basis
# of development workflow management:
#
# 1. prerequisites - What must happen before
# 2. downstream_required - What must happen after
# 3. downstream_suggested - What should probably happen after

relationships:
  # Tasks that must be completed before this task can run
  - name: prerequisites
    description: Tasks that must be completed before this task
    direction: backward

  # Tasks that must be completed after this task
  - name: downstream_required
    description: Tasks that must be completed after this task
    direction: forward

  # Tasks that are recommended to run after this task
  - name: downstream_suggested
    description: Tasks that are recommended to be completed after this task
    direction: forward
